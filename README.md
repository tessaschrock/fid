## Description:
##### This GitHub Repository is meant to hold website design projects for my Fundamentals of Interactive Design. It's a good alternative so I don't need to purchase a domain. I used a [*different* website](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) to learn markdown text that helped me quite a bit with real examples. Fortunately I found that I already have some experience with it! I just never knew what it was called. For me, sometimes it's **rather difficult** to sit through multiple videos sometimes. I'll keep the link handy here so I can refer it for next time.
##### Here's a cute image of a dog to do some markdown practice. ![Doggo](https://en.bcdn.biz/Images/2016/11/15/776342f0-86f5-4522-84c9-a02d6b11c766.jpg)
