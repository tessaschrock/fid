## Description:
##### This GitHub Repository is meant to hold website design projects for my Fundamentals of Interactive Design. It's a good alternative so I don't need to purchase a domain. [I used a *different* website to learn markdown text that helped me quite a bit with real examples.](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) Fortunately I found that I already have experience with it! I just never knew what it was called. For me, sometimes it's **rather difficult** to sit through multiple videos sometimes. I'll keep the link handy here so I can refer it for next time.
